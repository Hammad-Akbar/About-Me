# About-Me

Throughout my time in college, I stumbled between majors, indecisively alternating between different engineering and math. I had always imagined myself drawing away on a blueprint to make some device. Did it sound like fun? Not at all, and that is when I discovered the joy of programming.

I found joy in solving problems. I relish the challenge that it inspired. This was when I discovered my first programming language, Python. It has become a rewarding part of my day to day life. My desire to learn about programming was amplified when I discovered HTML, CSS and Javascript. Being able to envision an idea and bring it to life by typing code into a computer was inspiring. It began my journey into Software Engineering.

My passion for software development could not be contained. That was when I started working for The Coder School as a Software Development Code Coach. This position allowed me to inspire children and teenagers about the joy of software engineering by teaching them how to program in languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

I continued my journey into software development and started creating my own web applications. I built a web application with engineers from Bloomberg and Facebook, using Scrum and Agile methodologies that enables users to learn about American politics, take ideology quizzes, participate in public polls, and explore the political geography of the United States of America. I developed this web application on AWS utilizing Python as my backend and PostgreSQL for my database. The front end was developed utilizing functional ReactJS and webpack components. I also incorporated multiple APIs by parsing JSON structures.

What I bring to the table is not just skills that do the job. I have a passion for what I am doing and I am continuously inspired to create beautiful and functional products. I hope to continue learning and improving myself and my abilities to become a more successful version of myself.
